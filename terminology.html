            <h2>Terminology</h2>

            <div class="term-card">
                <h3>Neurodiversity</h3>
                <p>Neurodiversity is the concept that variations in brain function and behavior are normal and natural aspects of human diversity. People fundamentally experience and interact with the world in different ways to varying degrees, and there is no single "correct" way of thinking, learning, and behaving. As we understand more about how people's experiences differ, we can adapt our actions and world to account for every person's experience.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="term-card">
                <h3>Neurotypical</h3>
                <p>Refers to an individual who thinks, perceives, and behaves in ways that are statistically and/or socially considered the norm by the general population.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="term-card">
                <h3>Neurodiverse</h3>
                <p>Refers to an individual whose brain works in a way that isn’t expected or isn’t considered to be the norm; they may function differently in terms of learning, social interaction, and communication.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="term-card">
                <h3>Neurodevelopmental Conditions</h3>
                <p>Conditions that affect the development of the nervous system, including the brain, causing growth and interaction to differ from expected patterns. Individuals may need alternative methods for learning and communication to support their growth.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="term-card">
                <h3>Restricted Repetitive Behaviors</h3>
                <p>Behaviors that can include fixations on specific patterns of interest, strict adherence to routines, or repetitive movements. These behaviors vary from person to person and in severity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="term-card">
                <h3>Hyperfocus</h3>
                <p>The capacity to exclusively engage in one task or activity while tuning out others. It is a type of automatic attention that occurs faster and with less effort.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="term-card">
                <h3>Special Interests</h3>
                <p>Intense focus on specific topics or hobbies, often lifelong or changing over time. Examples include characters, music, books, or paintings.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="term-card">
                <h3>Sensory Sensitivity</h3>
                <p>A biologically-based trait characterized by increased awareness of environmental stimuli. Highly sensitive individuals process sensory input deeply, which can sometimes lead to avoidance behaviors.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="term-card">
                <h3>Stimming</h3>
                <p>"Stimming" refers to self-stimulatory behaviors, such as repetitive movements or sounds, often used by individuals to manage sensory input or regulate emotions.</p>
