                            <p style="color: black; font-weight: 600;">Neurodiversity is the concept that variations in brain function and behavior are normal and natural aspects of human diversity. People fundamentally experience and interact with the world in different ways to varying degrees and there is no single, "correct" way of thinking, learning, and behaving. There are neurological differences that can negatively impact a person's ability to navigate the world we live in. As we understand more about how people's experience differ, we can adapt our actions and our world to make sure every person's experience is accounted for. The term was coined in the 1990s by Australian sociologist Judy Singer.</p>

While it's technically incorrect to refer to an individual as "neurodiverse", very few people will be offended or even aware of the distinction. It’s a very common mix-up, and the intended meaning is usually clear.</p>

For example, a workplace with people who are both neurotypical and neurodivergent is neurodiverse. The term emphasizes diversity within the group, not an individual.</p>

                                <br><br>It's important to remember that not all neurodiverse traits are inherently "deficits"; many conditions that fall under the umbrella of neurodiversity are associated with certain heightened abilities. For example, many people diagnosed with autism perform exceptionally well in tasks that center around memory and pattern recognition. However, some traits become disabling in environments that are not accommodating or inclusive. This perspective aligns with the social model of disability, which views disability as arising partly from societal barriers rather than solely from an individual's condition. The good news is that the best way to address barriers like social isolation, stigma and misunderstanding is by educating ourselves about this aspect of human diversity, something that you're doing right now!</p>

                                        Identity first language for neurodiversity emphasizes a person's difference as a fundamental part of who they are, and challenges the notion that being neurodivergent is negative or needs to be separated from their identity.

                                        For example, identity first language addresses those with autism with the following language:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>

                                        Some people prefer this method of reference because it emphasizes that a person who is neurodivergent is first and most importantly, a person. This reduces the risk of defining people solely by their disability.

                                The language used to refer to neurodiverse populations—identity-first vs. person-first—is still a topic of ongoing discussion within neurodiversity advocacy groups. Different individuals, groups, and communities may prefer one over the other based on their personal experiences and the meanings they attach to the terms. If you find yourself referring to someone who is neurodivergent, it's best to ask them which language they prefer, as a small but meaningful way to demonstrate respect and understanding.

                            <p style="color: black; font-weight: 600;">A biologically-based trait characterized by increased awareness and sensitivity to the environment. A highly sensitive person processes sensory stimuli and information more strongly and deeply than others. Many autistic individuals also experience this.</p>
                            <p style="color: black; font-weight: 600;">Children especially try to avoid sensory experiences – for example, they might cover their ears when they hear loud noises.</p>

Many autistic people have passionate and highly focused interests, often from a fairly young age. These can change over time or be lifelong. They can be characters, music, books, animals, paintings, etc.</p>

                            <p style="color: black; font-weight: 600;">Masking is a coping mechanism used by some individuals to hide or suppress their neurodivergent effects or traits to blend in socially; it can be conscious or unconscious but this can cause people to lose their unique identity and can lead problems with mental health, exhaustion, anxiety and loss of self-identity.</p>

                                A key term that many people use as a distinction between different disabilities and different forms of neurodiversity is by categorizing them as "visible" or "invisible". It's very important to understand that some people deal with challenges  we can't see.</p>

                                        Visible signs of neurodiversity are the traits that can be easily perceived by others. Common visible neurodiverse traits include stimming, restrictive repetitive behaviors, and noticeable social awkwardness.
                                        <br><br>For example, Tourette's syndrome is characterized with physical tics like shoulder shrugging, and repeated arm/hand movements, as well as vocal tics like repeating phrases and echoing others' words(echolalia). These traits are easier to notice.

                                        Invisible signs of neurodiversity are not immediately apparent to others and include sensory sensitivity, hyperfocus, and special interests.
