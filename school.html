                    <h2>Accommodations</h2>
                </a>
                <p>Students who have an IDD, are neurodiverse, or are part of the special education program will usually receive learning accommodations or modes to help them succeed. Since every student is different and has different skills or learning styles, accommodations for each student are customized to the individual. Here are some common learning accommodations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Extended time on tests, and/or taking tests in quieter secluded areas</li>
                    <li>Visual, auditory, and/or written instructions (e.g. a graphic organizer + spoken and written down instructions for an assignment)</li>
                    <li>Noise cancelling headphones to mitigate distraction</li>
                    <li>Flexible schedules to learn when students are most attentive and focused, as well as supervised breaks</li>
                    <li>Sitting in specific areas in the classroom away from loud noises, crowds, and other distractions to mitigate sensory overload</li>
                    <li>Fidget toys for de-stress and focus</li>
                    <li>Lighting of the classroom can be adjusted to help students to mitigate sensory distractions</li>
                    <li>Instructional Assistants (school employees) can help students stay focused, understand content, and organize their schoolwork</li>
                    <li>Positive reinforcement as well as the repetition of tasks and policies to help students retain information better</li>
                    <li>Counselors may provide emotional or academic support</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These are just some of the accommodations provided by teachers and counselors at different schools. It's important to remember not every neurodiverse student needs all these accommodations, and others may. Be respectful of students who may have a different learning style than yourself, and understand that it was something they were born with, not something they can control. In the end, we are all needing some help whether it comes to emotional support, tutoring, or physical support, but it differs from person to person.</p>

                <p style="font-weight: bold; max-width: 1300px; font-size: 20px;">As we know many people in our community process and act upon information differently. This often affects social interaction and a person's ability to build and maintain connections.</p>

                        <p>There are many unspoken signals present in social interactions, such as body language, facial expressions, gestures, and tone of voice that come together in each person to express themselves. These cues can indicate people's:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Emotional state - e.g. happy or frustrated, often through facial expression and tone of voice.</li>

                            <li style="padding-top: 10px; font-weight: bold;">Readiness to transition - e.g. shifting topics or ending conversation, often through posture and looking away.</li>
                            <li style="padding-top: 10px; font-weight: bold;">Comfort level - e.g. nervousness or trust, often through body language and personal space.</li>

                <p class="communication-section-warning">It's important to understand that a diverse range of communication styles and habits are valid. The most enjoyable friendships often form when all parties are comfortable with their way of communicating.
                    <br><br>It's also important for neurodivergent and neurotypical people alike to be aware of other communication styles. This is so that misunderstandingsâ€”such as perceiving someone as rude, strange, or inappropriateâ€”donâ€™t become barriers to connection between students with different ways of communicating.

                <div>
                    <h3 class="communication-section-nuerotypical">Neurotypical</h3>
                    <p class="communication-section-nuerotypical-content">Neurotypical people use and interpret nonverbal cues, and are often more comfortable with eye contact.
                        <br><br>Neurotypical students often use figurative language to convey meanings that differ from it's literal meaning. For example someone who's confused might use "I can't wrap my head around it." as a metaphor. Additionally, neurotypical people often use hyperboles, such as "I didn't eat breakfast today; I'm starving," if they were very hungry.
                        <br><br>Many neurotypical students find it easy to switch back and forth between topics. Using nonverbal cues, neurotypical students can also sense when it's time to move on from a particular subject</p>

                <div>
                    <h3 class="communication-section-nuerodiverse">Neurodiverse</h3>
                    <p class="communication-section-nuerodiverse-content"> Neurodiverse students' brains process visual and auditory information differently, and therefore interpret unspoken social cues differently in conversation. 
                        <br><br>For many students with autism, interpreting these signals is often difficult, and eye contact may feel uncomfortable, distracting or unnecessary. Students with autism may have to actively think about these social cues, which can be mentally exhausting. For this reason they may feel comfortable using a flat affect (facial expression and tone of voice). 
                        <br><br>Difficult interpreting social cues can affect sensing readiness to transition, such as when to take turns, and when it's appropriate to change subjects. Additionally, students with ADHD may unintentionally interrupt others due to impulsivity or excitement.3
                        <br><br>Students with autism may interpret language very literally. Metaphors and exaggerations like "I can't wrap my head around it," or "I didn't eat breakfast today. I'm starving." can be taken at face value. This impacts a person's ability to understand humor, idioms and everyday phrases people often use in conversation. For this reason, neurodiverse students may prefer to speak directly and literally.
                        <br><br>Neurodiverse individuals often info dumping about specific subjects (sometimes referred to as "special interests" for autism or "hyperfocus" for ADHD) with each other. With less pressure to conform to social norms, and less chance of being judged for talking too much, it can be relaxing to go into detail about these interests.

                <p class="sensory-section-content">For many neurodivergent students, their brains take in sensory inputâ€”like bright flickering lights, background noises, or physical contact in crowded hallwaysâ€”more intensely. This can make it harder to focus and/or unpleasant to be in certain types of environments.</p>

                <p class="emotional-regulation-section-content">For many neurodivergent students, emotional regulation in the school setting can be more challenging due to consistent sensory overload, social dynamics, and unexpected changes. Stimuli like loud noises in the cafeteria, crowded hallways, or sudden schedule shifts can trigger emotional responses, making it difficult to remain calm or focused. Students may experience frustration, anxiety, or overwhelm more readily, as their brains process and react to environmental and social factors differently. Understanding and creating supportive spaces can help foster emotional stability and enable students to thrive academically and socially.</p>
