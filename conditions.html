                <p class="note">Note: The exact causes/origins of many of these conditions is still an active area of research. What we can say is that there are both environmental and genetic factors that influence a person's likelihood of being neurodivergent. These conditions and their symptoms can all be found in the The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5-TR) published by the American Psychiatric Association.</p>

                            Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
                        </strong> 
                        is a big part of neurodiversity as it encompasses a vast range of divergent behaviors.
                        ASD is a neurological and developmental condition that affects how people interact, communicate, learn, and behave.
                        Although autism can be diagnosed at any age, it is described as a “developmental condition” because symptoms normally
                        appear in the first 2 years of a child's life. It is called Autism Spectrum Disorder because it refers to a range of 
                        symptoms and severity levels. One autistic individual will not necessarily have the same experience as another autistic individual.
                    </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong style="color: black;">
                                An estimated 5.4 million people (2.21%) in the US have Autism.

                            People diagnosed with Autism often display elevated abilities, including but not limited to:
                        </p>
                    <ul> 
                        <li>Hypersensitivity to sensory details, resulting in greater ability to identify visual patterns, and greater auditory/pitch and olfactory(smell) detection</li>
                        <li>Correlation with intellectual giftedness and savant syndrome; where a person with limited cognitive abilities/emotional range has an exceptional ability in a specific area(e.g., music, mathematics). </li>
                        <li>Superior Problem Solving/Rational Decison-Making Skills</li>
                        <li>Exceptional Memory</li>

                    <h3>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</h3>
                    <p>
                        ADHD, or Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, is a condition that affects how people focus, control their impulses, and manage their energy levels. Individuals with ADHD often experience ongoing challenges with paying attention, sitting still, and thinking before acting, which can make daily activities—like school, work, or social interactions—more difficult. These patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity are not just occasional behaviors but consistent traits that can impact various areas of daily life. ADHD usually begins in childhood with the average age of diagnosis being 7, but its effects can continue into adulthood, influencing how people manage responsibilities and relationships.

                                Sometimes described as "constant fogginess or feeling of being zoned out." People with this type often struggle to pay attention to details, stay on task, or listen during extended conversations due to their mind constantly wandering/jumping between different thoughts. They may appear forgetful, easily distracted, or daydream frequently. This presentation tends to be less outwardly visible.

                                Often described as "a motor inside you that never stops running." People with this type often struggle with sitting still, staying quiet, or waiting turns. They may frequently fidget, talk excessively or interrupt others. These behaviors are more noticeable in structured or quiet settings.

                                The combined type of ADHD includes symptoms of both hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattention. People with this presentation may experience difficulty staying focused and organized, while also struggling with impulsive actions, and difficulty staying still. This type often results in a complex interplay of challenges that can affect multiple areas of life, including academics, work, and relationships.
