                            <h3>1. Diversity is Strength</h3>
                            <p>Throughout human history and evolution, diversity has been the foundation of resilience, innovation, and growth. The fact that every person's brain works differently enables us to build a tapestry of ideas and solutions that no singular brain function could achieve. Like ecosystems that thrive on biological diversity, human communities flourish when we allow diverse cognitive styles to complement each other in school, work, and social environments.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="topfive-item">
                            <h3>2. Everybody's Brain Works Differently</h3>
                            <p>
                                Neurodiversity has a biological basis. No two brains have the exact same neural wiring. Individual differences in how brains function arise from differences in intricate neural structures, connectivity, and plasticity. Variations in major brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, or sensory systems, influence how people process sensory information, and respond to the world around them. These differences are shaped by genetics, environment, and life experiences, creating diverse cognitive profiles in areas like memory, attention, language, motor control, and problem-solving.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The underlying biological origins of neurodiversity is currently an active area of scientific interest and study. With rapidly improving Artificial Intelligence applications that analyze massive amounts of data—like how our 86 billion neurons interact—our understanding of cognition is expanding faster than ever.

                            <h3>3. Clinical Neurodiversity</h3>
                            <p>
                                From a clinical perspective, certain forms of neurodiversity—dyslexia for example—are diagnosable based on criteria outlined in tools like the DSM-5-TR (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These diagnoses often rely on behaviors and challenges that significantly impact an individual's ability to function in educational, social, or occupational settings. However, some symptoms—such as stable facial expressions tone of voice and cadence for autism spectrum disorder—are merely different from what is considered normal.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Controversy exists over which aspects of neurodiversity should be treated. For instance, medication for individuals with ADHD is widely regarded as beneficial, as it can enhance focus manage impulsivity, significantly improving educational outcomes and daily functioning. However, in the case of autism spectrum disorder, the approach is more debated. Sensitivities to sensory input (e.g. noise, lights, physical contact) might warrant accommodations to reduce  distress in many environments, but suppressing traits such as stimming or alternative communication styles are often criticized for harming a person's true identity and self-expression.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ultimately, the best approach is nuanced and case by case—one that embraces neurodiverse traits while providing treatment when symptoms create significant challenges. Balancing acceptance with intervention requires weighing the costs and benefits and, above all, respecting the individual's autonomy and choices of whether they'd like to receive treatment.

                            <h3>4. Language Matters</h3>
                            <p>
                                Specifically regarding the use of terms like 'retarded,' 'SPED,' and 'autistic' in derogatory manners.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The word retarded was historically used in clinical and educational settings to describe individuals with intellectual disabilities. However now that it has been officially removed from clinical language, the word is used to insult and belittle people with cognitive or developmental differences. It perpetuates stigma and stereotypes that diminish neurodivergent individuals as less capable and less valuable. It promotes disrespect and can cause emotional distress, anxiety, and feelings of worthlessness. This negative impact on self-esteem can be long-lasting.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As for the use of word such as 'SPED' or 'Autistic,' these are relevant terms that describe real programs and real people who can hear how we use these words. The problem isn't the terms themselves, but the problem arises when they become synonymous with 'stupid' in academic, occupational and social contexts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Using inclusive, respectful language helps build connection and fosters a community where everyone is valued for their unique abilities, rather than belittled for their neurological differences.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="topfive-item">
                            <h3>5. "Conditions" are Not Inherently Negative</h3>
                            <p>
                                When we hear the word "condition" we often associate it with a disease or illness, and it generally has a negative connotation. It is true that many symptoms of neurodivergent conditions, such as ADHD, autism, dyslexia, often include challenges in certain environments or deficits in certain tasks.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But it is equally true that neurodivergent conditions often are associated with other strenghts and aptitudes. For instance, individuals with ADHD often possess high levels of creativity and energy, while those on the autism spectrum often excel in attention to detail, pattern recognition, memorization.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While not every neurodivergent condition has associated strengths, it's better to shift away from the negative connotation, and relocate that effort into recognize each person's different aptitudes.
                            </p>
